# Issues Found along the way

## Overview
This is a list of issues that should be fixed or thought about again in order to gain performance

- Realtime location base css is generated via *LESS* file that is compiled on the fly to a css and then send back to the client.
-

## Low Priority

## Things not implemented for POC
- Complete all form fields types.
- Left to right / right to left support.
- Some special cases of style (desktop / background transparent, etc..)
